# What is Caprica Tech?

Caprica Tech started as an idea of portfolio site for showing off Cloud labs and things I was learning years ago. Some of the material was written into an old WordPress site which I have disabled sometime in 2019. Later I moved from WordPress hosted environment to EC2 groups, but hosting a proper EC2 with LB was not a cost I wanted to have and kind of deployment, so I started looking static and serverless solutions. Basically all Jamstack fullfil this, besides a learning curve.


Eventually I wanted got sometime to start up something on AWS Amplify to explore the product and mirrored with GitHub pages for awhile to test. Later, to avoid using GitHub pages for general blogging, I kept using only AWS Amplify.


## Updates
